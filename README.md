# We've used weight pruning technique to get efficiency in CNN models

Weight pruning means eliminating unnecessary values in the weight tensors. We are practically setting the neural network parametersâ€™ values to zero to remove what we estimate are unnecessary connections between the layers of a neural network. This is done during the training process to allow the neural network to adapt to the changes.

# API used in this project 
You can get the code here : https://github.com/madhavtripathi05/green-lens-api 

we have split 9 models in 3 different API each API contains three models so the response time as well as the server load can be decreased as we've hosted it on heroku.

# API Port and host 
you can change host and port number in app.js File
